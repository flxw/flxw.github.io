title: How wearable apps should work
---

Having looked at wearables intensively for several weeks, I want to share my vision
of how they should be treated. Being mere data displays until now, wearable technology
has the potential to be so much more. Making data actionable is what I am talking about.

Wearables I have looked at include: Withings Ox, Fitbits Charge HR, Motorolas Moto 360
and the Misfit Shine. All three have feature-rich applications doing
a good job at visualizing the collected data.

Just take a look at the gorgeous graph xx draws for xxyy data:

The data displayed is very clear. It displays aslasld
We can view a similar graph for the day before, the day before that,
the week before that, some months back and so on. We can
also view monthly statistics.

Would we be able to derive actionable insights from the data? What use is six months worth
of data if you have no clue about how to read it? Machines are very good at deriving
patterns from great amounts of data -  and I believe that this capability should be put to use.

## Providing background information

Let's have a look at this graph of sleep information.
It tells me when I experienced deep sleep and light sleep and when my body moved during sleeping.
Now I can see when I entered a different sleep phase. But what will I do with this information?
Can I improve my sleep based on this data? I *could*.

## Giving actionable advice

If I knew about basic sleep mechanisms and how behaviour before going to bed affects our sleep.
Certainly no secret, the blue light emitted by electronic devices affects our sleep in a [bad way](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side).
Wouldn't it be great if such an insight was shared with users of the app?

I believe that the user should not have to have to analyze the data himself (although he should certainly have the possibility to do so),
but that analytics should give actionable advice, if it can be given. This way, a source
for information overload is reduced and the matter is only brought to our attention if
it is neccessary. One possibility might be via simple notification:

< notification image: did you sleep badly?
Try turning off your cellphone one hour before you go to bed
Exercise in the morning instead of the evening. A hard-working metabolism will
keep you awake. Your high heart rate and the amount of steps taken suggest that this might have been the reason. >
