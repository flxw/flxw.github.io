Hi, I'm Felix. Thanks for visiting my site.

I studied IT-Systems Engineering at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute (HPI) in Potsdam, Germany.
After brief stints in consulting and product management, I am back in software engineering.
Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Celonis, and in my free time I spend a lot of time with Rust.
You can also find me on <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/felix-wolff" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn.</a>

Here is a short version of my CV, peppered with keywords on technologies I used and duties I carried out during that time.

**2019 - M.Sc. IT-Systems Engineering @ [Hasso-Plattner-Institute](https://hpi.de)**\\
I wrote my thesis on *Next-Activity Prediction with Long-Short-Term Memory Recurrent Networks*.
The topic got me in touch with my current employer.

**2015 - B.Sc. IT-Systems Engineering @ [Hasso-Plattner-Institute](https://hpi.de)**\\
The six semesters here taught me a lot about natural curiousity on technology,
the bitcoin hype and the immense value of reliable teammates.
I wrote my thesis on *Preselecting Job Candidates Through Data Analysis*.
The topic was nice, and it was a cool confirmation that in the years after, several startups tried out what I had sketched in my thesis.
They tried to find good candidates for jobs based on their Github profiles, but I think Github took that business to themselves.

**2012 - Abitur @ [Paul-von-Denis-Gymnasium](https://gym-schiff.de)**\\
Finishing school and convincing my IT teacher that Python is in fact an object-oriented language.
In hindsight I would have loved to replace religion as a subject with financial literacy.

**2006 - Four year expat stay @ [DSKL](https://dskl.edu.my)**\\
We (family and I) were abroad and I got pretty good at speaking English and imitating Indian accents :D
