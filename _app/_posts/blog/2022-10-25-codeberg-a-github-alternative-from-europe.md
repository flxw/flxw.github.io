When I started getting into computers in 2010, GitHub was not yet owned by Microsoft,
and had several contenders:
self-hosted gits, SourceForge, SVN and especially Gitorious.
I remember really liking Gitorious.

Well, that was over ten years ago, and now git and GitHub reign supreme.
GitLab is the notable exception.

I was very excited to learn that an alternative to GitHub is forming on my continent - Europe!
It's called [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org).
I found it via [this blog post](https://ruky.me/2022/10/17/codeberg-a-github-alternative-from-europe/),
and immediately created an [account](https://codeberg.org/flxw).

In the wake of how GitHub handled OSS licenses with Copilot,
I will start exploring the platform in the next weeks and write about it.
