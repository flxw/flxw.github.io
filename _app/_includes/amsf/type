  Include type

  Define include type of this file, make sure code snippets work smoothly on
  both `page` and `post` and whatever content types:

  {%- include amsf/core type=post -%}

  Or you can include this helper directly:

  {%- include amsf/type type=post -%}

  @since 1.1.4
{%- endcomment -%}
{%- assign type = include.type | default: page -%}
