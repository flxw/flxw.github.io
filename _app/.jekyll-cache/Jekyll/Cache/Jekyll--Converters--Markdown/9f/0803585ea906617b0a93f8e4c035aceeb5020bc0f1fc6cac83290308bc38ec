I"<<p>When I started getting into computers in 2010, GitHub was not yet owned by Microsoft,
and had several contenders:
self-hosted gits, SourceForge, SVN and especially Gitorious.
I remember really liking Gitorious.</p>

<p>Well, that was over ten years ago, and now git and GitHub reign supreme.
GitLab is the notable exception.</p>

<p>I was very excited to learn that an alternative to GitHub is forming on my continent - Europe!
Itâ€™s called <a href="https://codeberg.org">Codeberg</a>.
I found it via <a href="https://ruky.me/2022/10/17/codeberg-a-github-alternative-from-europe/">this blog post</a>,
and immediately created an <a href="https://codeberg.org/flxw">account</a>.</p>

<p>In the wake of how GitHub handled OSS licenses with Copilot,
I will start exploring the platform in the next weeks and write about it.</p>
