I"[<p>A couple of years ago, I started getting more and more into understanding how the financial system works,
what inflation is, what the central banks do, etc, pp.
Finally I ended getting a lot more thorough in terms of looking into where my money and time goes.
I would like to highlight the account structure and the two tools I have been using every since in this article.
I believe that the whole setup is fairly simple and can be used by anybody, so I would like to share it.
For every piece of the two-part system, I will first give a general description and then a bit of detail how I do it.</p>
