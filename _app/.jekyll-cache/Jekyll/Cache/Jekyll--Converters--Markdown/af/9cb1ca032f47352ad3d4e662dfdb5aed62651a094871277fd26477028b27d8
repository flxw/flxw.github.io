I".<p>As a financially avid reader, I am sure that you can roughly say how much money you need for a month.
You can assist your gut feeling with tools like Kmymoney, Homebank, GnuCash et al. to know exactly how much it is that you spend and earn per month.
However, the aforementioned tools have a common shortcoming, at least in my opinion:
They use different data formats to store data.
If the software reaches end of life, you could lose months or even years of transactional data because you might not be able to extract it from the old storage format.</p>
