A while ago, I came across [a website](https://sneak.berlin) that encouraged me to directly reach out to the author or join his mailing list.
Since I have become disenchanted with the idea of social media, I am increasingly fond of this idea.

To follow me, please check the [RSS feed](/blog/feed.xml) of my blog.
You can get in touch with me via [wolff.felix@protonmail.com](mailto:wolff.felix@protonmail.com).
I am looking forward to receiving your message, it's always to hear about different points of view!

You can get my public PGP key as follows from Protonmail:
```bash
curl https://api.protonmail.ch/pks/lookup?op=get&search=wolff.felix@protonmail.com
