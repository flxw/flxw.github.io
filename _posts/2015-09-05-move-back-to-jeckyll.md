title: Moving back-back to Jeckyll
---

Today, I made the move away from [[harp](http://harpjs.com) and back to Jeckyll.
Dissatisfied with the complexity of publishing an article, I also moved the blog
to GitHub pages. This saves me money for the webserver and time for publishing a post.

## Welcome [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)!
## Welcome [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com)!

The whole blog structure has been refactored, so that you may easily clone the blog,
exchange some pictures and have a blog that is similar to mine!
It is especially easy to add custom tiles with JS logic on the front page now!
Stylus has been backported to SASS, so it compiles easily on Github.
Personally I prefer Stylus for its brevity.
