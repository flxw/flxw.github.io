title: Introducing HarpJS
---

Today, I made the move away from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) toward
a static site generation engine that enables me to enrich this website
both visually as well as content-wise.

## Welcome [harp](http://harpjs.com)!

It allows for different styling of each facet of my site. Futhermore, it enables
you to get up to speed with develop really quick as it leverages *conventions over configurations*.

Of course it is powered by 100% completely awesome Javascript ;)
