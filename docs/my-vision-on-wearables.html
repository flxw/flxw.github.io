    <p>Having looked at wearables intensively for several weeks, I want to share my vision
of how they should be developed further. Being mere data displays until now, wearable technology
has the potential to be so much more. Making data actionable is what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Wearables I have looked at include: Withings Ox, Fitbits Charge HR, Motorolas Moto 360
and the Misfit Shine. All of these feature step and sleeptracking capabilities
and have accompanying feature-rich applications doing a good job at
visualizing the collected data.</p>

<p>Just take a look at the gorgeous graph web-based Google Fit draws for
my step data (as of September 2015):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/wearables-walk-stat.png" alt="Google Fit walking statistics" /></p>

<p>The data displayed is very clear. It displays how many steps I have made
each day within a week.
We can view a similar graph for the day before, the day before that,
the week before that, some months back and so on. We can
also view monthly statistics.</p>

<p>Would we be able to derive actionable insights from the data? What use is six months worth
of data if you have no clue about how to read it? Does it deliver any value besides “Oh that is a lot”
or “oh that is not so much”? Machines are very good at deriving
patterns from great amounts of data - and I believe that this capability should be put to use.</p>

<p><em>Providing background information</em></p>

<p>Let’s have a look at this graph of sleep information.
It tells me when I experienced deep sleep and light sleep and when my body moved during sleeping.
Now I can see when I entered a different sleep phase. But what will I do with this information?
Can I improve my sleep based on this data? I <em>could</em>, if I knew how.</p>

<p><em>Giving actionable advice</em></p>

<p>I could make changes if I knew about basic sleep mechanisms and how behaviour before going to bed affects sleep.
Certainly no secret, the blue light emitted by electronic devices affects our sleep in a <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side">bad way</a>.
Wouldn’t it be great if such an insight was shared with users of the app?</p>

<p>I believe that the user should not have to have to analyze the data himself (although he should certainly have the possibility to do so),
but that analytics should give actionable advice, if it can be given. This way, a source
for information overload is reduced and the matter is only brought to our attention if
it is demanding. One possibility might be via simple Google Now Card:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/wearables-google-now-advice.png" alt="Google Now Card sleep advice" /></p>

<p>There is already an app that does something in that direction. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep">Sleep as Android</a> gives recommendations on how to catch up on sleep deficit, although
these tips are standardized and not tailored to ones demands.</p>

<p>If anyone of Misfit, Fitbit, Withings, Google or Motorola reads this: These devices are great!
Team up with some fitness experts and give your product an edge over the competition!
What makes a tracker really valuable is the data analytics, not the hardware. Take a look
at <a href="http://freeletics.com">Freeletics</a> for example. They provide members with weekly tips and insights
in bodily functions and regeneration mechanics. This information could easily be reused in
your applications!</p>
